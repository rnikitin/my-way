# Research ML

## What This Is

Use this archetype for machine learning research projects where iteration, experiment tracking, reproducibility, and evidence quality matter more than feature velocity.

Canonical local example: `~/dev/xlstm-predictor`.

This archetype fits projects with changing hypotheses, many experiments, long-running jobs, notebooks, local artifacts, and promotion gates that must distinguish real signal from leakage, bias, or overfit.

## MCP Servers

Keep mandatory and recommended MCP servers to five total. Add others only when a project has a proven need.

| Status | Name | Why for this archetype |
|--------|------|------------------------|
| mandatory | [`context7`](../mcp/context7.md) | Pulls current framework and library docs without relying on stale model memory. |
| mandatory | [`filesystem`](../mcp/filesystem.md) | Lets agents read local datasets, artifacts, and experiment files without broad context dumps. |
| recommended | [`chrome`](../mcp/chrome.md) | Useful for visual checks of notebooks, dashboards, plots, and local reports. |
| recommended | [`postgres`](../mcp/postgres.md) | Useful when experiment metadata, feature stores, or evaluation results live in Postgres. |
| recommended | [`notion`](../mcp/notion.md) | Useful for syncing polished research writeups or PM-facing summaries. |

## Tools

| Status | Name | Why |
|--------|------|-----|
| mandatory | [`uv`](../tools/uv.md) | Fast, reproducible Python environment and dependency management. |
| mandatory | [`pytest`](../tools/pytest.md) | Unit and integration checks for data transforms, losses, and evaluation gates. |
| mandatory | [`ruff`](../tools/ruff.md) | Fast lint and formatting checks. |
| mandatory | [`mypy`](../tools/mypy.md) | Type checks for boundaries that must stay stable. |
| mandatory | [`wandb`](../tools/wandb.md) | Experiment tracking when runs need metrics, configs, and artifacts. |
| optional | `marimo` | Notebook-style exploratory UI with more reproducible execution than ad hoc notebooks. |

| mandatory | `writing-plans` | Produces explicit, reviewable plans for multi-step experiments and refactors. |
| mandatory | `test-driven-development` | Keeps measurable behavior in front of implementation details. |
| mandatory | `systematic-debugging` | Prevents random retries when metrics or tests regress. |
| mandatory | `verification-before-completion` | Forces evidence before claiming completion. |
| recommended | `executing-plans` | Helps execute existing plans step-by-step with checkpoints. |
| recommended | `subagent-driven-development` | Useful when independent experiment audits can run in parallel. |
| recommended | `using-git-worktrees` | Keeps exploratory changes isolated from active work. |
| recommended | `finishing-a-development-branch` | Standardizes validation and closeout. |
| recommended | `execplan` | Better for long-running research plans that must survive context resets. |

## Templates

- [`templates/agents-md/research-ml.md`](../templates/agents-md/research-ml.md) - copy to `AGENTS.md` and fill project-specific placeholders.
- [`templates/claude-md/research-ml.md`](../templates/claude-md/research-ml.md) - copy to `CLAUDE.md` when using Claude Code.
- [`templates/execplan/EXECPLAN.md`](../templates/execplan/EXECPLAN.md) - use for long-running experiment plans, phase plans, and architecture changes.

## Suggested Project Layout

Use this as a starting point, then conform to the existing project if it already has a good structure.

    └── artifacts/  # local or ignored run outputs
```

## Memory Discipline

Use a routing index so the agent knows where to look first:

- `memory/index.md` - memory map and startup reads
- `memory/context.md` - live status board only
- `memory/feedback/` - durable corrections about how to work
- `memory/knowledge/` - permanent research and technical lessons
- `docs/phase_registry.md` - source of truth for active, frozen, skipped, and completed phases

Keep raw run artifacts out of memory. Store them under ignored `data/` or the experiment tracking system.

## Secrets & Auth

Never commit secrets or raw credentials.

Recommended locations:

- `.env` and `.env.local` for local-only environment values; both gitignored
- `wandb login` for W&B credentials
- Postgres credentials in environment variables or a local secret manager
- Claude Code credentials in the tool's own local config
- Notion OAuth through the relevant MCP or app connector

Recommended `.gitignore` additions:

```gitignore
.env
.env.*
!.env.example
*.key
*.pem
wandb/
.aim/
data/**/artifacts/
data/**/runs/
```

## Eval Gates

Every promoted result should name its evidence type:

- hypothesis
- implementation result
- unit/integration test result
- single-split validation result
- holdout result
- leak-checked result
- multi-seed result
- paper or forward result
- production or live result

Minimum gate for model changes:

1. Dataset version or data snapshot recorded.
2. Train/validation/test or holdout policy documented.
3. Random seed or seed set documented.
4. Baseline comparison included.
5. Leakage, lookahead, and target-construction checks addressed.
6. Metrics and config saved in W&B, local JSON, or a phase report.
7. Promotion decision based on validation or predeclared gate, not post hoc test selection.

## Typical Pitfalls

- LLM-generated `AGENTS.md` -> Hand-curate from the template and delete generic filler.
- Instruction bloat -> Remove any rule inferable from code, package files, tests, or existing docs.
- Vague persona -> State the project domain, stack versions, and one concrete local pattern instead.
- Missing version specificity -> Name Python, CUDA, PyTorch, and major library versions when they affect behavior.
- Kitchen-sink session -> Reset or compact between exploration, implementation, and writeup.
- Trust-then-verify gap -> Every model change ships with an explicit holdout or reproducibility check.
- Beautiful metric trap -> Treat unusually strong metrics as suspicious until leakage, bias, and baseline checks pass.
- Artifact sprawl -> Keep ignored run outputs out of durable memory and summarize only durable findings.
- Test-only confidence -> Passing unit tests do not prove research validity; promotion gates still apply.

## First Setup Checklist

- [ ] Copy `templates/agents-md/research-ml.md` to `AGENTS.md`.

- [ ] Add a thin `CLAUDE.md` shim only if Claude Code is used.
- [ ] Create or update `memory/index.md` and `memory/context.md`.
- [ ] Create or update a phase registry if the project has multiple research phases.
- [ ] Add `.env.example` without secrets.
- [ ] Run the first verification command and record expected output in `README.md` or `AGENTS.md`.
